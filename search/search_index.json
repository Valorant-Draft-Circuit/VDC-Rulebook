This competition is not affiliated with or sponsored by Riot Games, Inc. or VALORANT Esports. General Section 1. Introduction 1.1 VDC: Explained 1.1.1 Valorant Draft Circuit (VDC) is a different kind of Valorant experience: a league designed to operate like a professional sports league. General Managers draft players, make trades, set rosters, and compete to be the powerhouse that every team strives to beat the following season. 1.1.2 Our ultimate goal is to create a friendly environment for people to play competitive Valorant, regardless of their skill level. Section 2. League Information 2.1 Joining VDC 2.1.1 Joining the VDC Discord is required. The link to join is https://discord.gg/vdc 2.1.1.1 Leaving the Discord can lead to a one or more season ban from VDC, ruled on a case by case basis depending on various factors such as time into the season, duration of departure, league tenure, past punishment record, and more. 2.1.2 Sign up using the form in the #sign-ups channel in the Discord. If you fill it out incompletely or incorrectly, an Admin will contact you to fix the error before you are added to the draft pool. 2.1.2.1 Players that were a part of the prior season will receive an Intent form that they should fill out instead of the signup form. 2.1.2.2 Any and all accounts used to play Valorant should be reported on the signup form. Failure to do so can lead to an inaccurate placement, which may lead to removal from the league. 2.1.3 To enter the league, at least 1 of your accounts must be level 20 and have completed ranked placements in the current Act. Players have until the day before the draft to complete their placement games in order to be a part of the draft. Players that do not reach this deadline will have to sign up as an RFA (Restricted Free Agent) when they complete their matches. 2.1.3.1 If the offseason is ongoing when a new Act begins, the requirement to be ranked in the current Act will be waived and stats from the previous Act will be used. If the 10 placement matches were not completed in the previous Act, 10 matches must be played in the new Act. 2.1.4 Players entering the draft for the first time must play in 3 VDC official combine matches. These do not have to be played on separate combine match nights. 2.2 Broadcasting Rules 2.2.1 Players may stream, record, and upload VDC gameplay as they wish. 2.2.1.1 To protect the integrity of matches, we ask that any streams have at least a 2 minute delay enabled. 2.2.1.2 Please keep streams relatively family friendly. You are essentially representing the league in any content while playing in VDC. This includes informing teammates that you are streaming/recording. 2.2.1.3 By signing up to VDC, you agree we may stream, record, and reupload any and all matches you play in the league. League Operations Section 3. General Operational Info 3.1 Tier Info 3.1.1 Currently, we have 4 tiers called Premier, Master, Advanced, and Contender from highest to lowest. When the rules mention promotion, this refers to players moving from lower tiers to higher ones. When the rules mention demotion, this refers to players moving from higher tiers to lower tiers. 3.1.1.1 Tiers will not be added or removed in the middle of a season. 3.1.1.2 Tiers may be added or removed during combines. Changes like this will be accompanied by an announcement in Discord. 3.1.2 Each franchise has at most one team per tier. Teams themselves do not move between tiers, but players may move between teams in different tiers. 3.1.3 Players can not move between tiers during a season, unless they are promoted by their General Manager. 3.1.4 Every tier has matches scheduled on the same days at the same time, with the exception of some playoff matches. 3.1.4.1 Matches will be scheduled on Wednesdays and Fridays, but may not be scheduled around major holidays. 3.1.4.2 Matches are scheduled to start at 9pm EST. 3.2 General Manager Rules 3.2.1 General Managers are selected by the Admins from players that have applied. 3.2.1.1 GMs are not required to play in the league. 3.2.1.2 GMs are selected based on a variety of factors including seasons in the league, AGM experience, punishment history, and past experiences outside VDC. 3.2.2 GMs are permitted to cut themselves from their team at any time post draft, if they wish. A GM who does this will not become a Free Agent. 3.2.2.1 A GM who wishes to return to their roster must treat this transaction the same as if they were picking up a Free Agent. 3.2.2.2 A GM can return to their roster in place of a player placed on IR. 3.2.2.3 A GM can not return to their roster temporarily as a substitute. 3.2.2.4 A GM can not substitute in a higher tier if they are not a part of a roster in their franchise. 3.3 Assistant General Managers 3.3.1 General Managers may appoint Assistant General Managers to help with franchise operations. These players must be approved for the position in a majority vote by Admins. There is a maximum number of AGM's allowed per franchise. 3.3.1.1 Currently, until all franchises have at least 3-4 teams (meaning we have 3-4 tiers), all franchises will only be allowed 1 AGM. 3.3.2 Each season, a franchise is allowed to switch AGM one time per AGM their franchise is allowed. For example, if a franchise is allowed one AGM by rule, they are allowed one switch of who is AGM per season. The switches restock the day GM changes are announced. 3.3.2.1 If a franchise takes over midseason, they are allowed to switch any AGMs one time, without using their allotted switches. 3.3.2.2 If a franchise has less than their allotted AGMs, appointing an AGM to reach the limit does not count as a switch. 3.3.2.3 An AGM stepping down due to leaving the league or leaving a franchise will count as a new AGM being appointed, not an AGM switch. 3.4 Player Contracts 3.4.1 When a player is drafted or signed from free agency, they enter a 2 season contract. 3.4.1.1 If the season is in progress when the player is signed, the season counts as season 1 of 2, regardless of how far into the season the signing occurs. 3.4.2 Players may not choose to leave a team while under contract, but may request to be cut or traded, subject to their GM's approval. 3.4.2.1 If a player is cut for refusing to play for their team, they will be suspended for half of the number of total matches in the season (rounded up) or until the match day following roster lock if the season is more than halfway completed. They will become an RFA after this time. 3.4.3 Contracts are tracked by season, not by week. 3.4.3.1 All contracts in a tier will be reduced by 1 season the day following the Championship match day for that tier. 3.4.4 Between seasons, player tiers move around and franchises are reassigned what tiers they have teams in. 3.4.4.1 If a player is promoted to a tier where their current franchise does not have a team, they will immediately become a Free Agent. 3.4.4.2 If a franchise loses a team in a tier they currently have players in, all players will immediately become Free Agents. 3.4.4.3 If a team moves from one franchise to another due to reassignments, the new franchise will take over all existing contracts. 3.4.5 When a contract ends, a player may agree to sign for an additional season if the GM invites them to do so. The number of contract extensions a player may make is not limited. 3.4.5.1 If the player does not renew their contract with a franchise they can not sign with that franchise until 2 match days have passed, including pre-season. 3.4.5.2 If they do not renew the contract by the contract renewal deadline they become a regular free agent, skipping waivers, and can be signed or drafted. 3.4.6 A player may agree to go on \"Inactive Reserve'' (IR) in the event they need to take an extended break. This allows the franchise to indefinitely replace them while keeping the rights to roster them once they return. 3.4.6.1 This break must last a minimum of 4 match days. 3.4.6.2 The MMR of the 6th player replaces the MMR of the player on IR. MMR cap rules still apply. 3.4.6.3 A player on IR is not allowed to play any matches until they are taken off IR. 3.5 Roster Rules 3.5.1 Rosters have a set number of players they must have. Rosters are by team, not by franchise. 3.5.2 Teams can not have more than 5 players, with two exceptions. 3.5.2.1 Between the draft and the first pre-season cut day, roster sizes are unlimited. 3.5.2.2 If a team puts a player on IR, they may add one extra rostered player. 3.5.3 Teams can not have less than 5 rostered players, unless poor draft planning results in fewer than 5 draft picks. In this case, a Free Agent must be picked up by the roster lock date. 3.5.4 Teams will still be allowed to play in a match should a team suffer a player loss outside of their control in the season, resulting in having 4 active players. 3.5.4.1 The roster should be back up to 5 players by the next match day, whether the missing player is cut or put on IR. 3.5.4.2 The only transactions allowed for such teams are signing Free Agents and promoting from a lower tier. 3.5.4.3 The MMR of the player or players lost is still active against the tier MMR cap until a replacement player or players are found. 3.6 MMR Caps 3.6.1 Each team has an MMR cap. Every team in a tier has the same cap. 3.6.2 The caps are adjusted at the beginning of every season, prior to the draft. 3.6.3 Each team must remain at or below their cap. Teams are not allowed to exceed their caps at any point, except during the period between the end of the previous season's playoffs and the Roster Lock following the current season's draft. 3.6.4 Re-signed players must stay on a roster through the draft. They cannot be cut anytime prior to the draft. They can be cut after the draft in the preseason and would then be placed on waivers. The waivers will follow the standard waiver rules. Waivers will be the inverse of draft order. Re-signed players cannot be traded until two match days have passed. Section 4. Transactions 4.1 General Transaction Rules 4.1.1 The season transaction deadline is one match day before the Playoffs begin, 30 minutes before that match begins. 4.1.1.1 Teams may only use 1 substitute player each match day following the season transaction deadline. 4.1.2 For a match day transaction to be processed for the current match day, it must be submitted 30 minutes before the match is scheduled to begin. 4.1.3 Transactions posted less than 30 minutes before a match is scheduled to begin will be handled as follows: 4.1.3.1 Substitution requests will be invalidated. 4.1.3.2 Trades, cuts, and signings will be made official for the next match day. 4.2 Waivers 4.2.1 VDC utilizes waivers to allow some teams to have a claim on players before others. Contracted players who are cut will go through a waiver period where they can be picked up by another team. 4.2.2 Players signed from waivers will retain the contract they had with their old franchise, and will not be given a fresh 2 season contract. 4.2.3 The waiver order is determined by tier, not the league as a whole. 4.2.4 Players can only be claimed from waivers to play for a team in the tier their waiver belongs to. 4.2.5 The waiver order is determined by the inverse of team standings, with the worst team in a tier getting the first waiver claim and the best team in a tier getting the last waiver claim. 4.2.5.1 The waiver order is updated on every 3rd match day, beginning Match Day 3. 4.2.5.2 When a team makes a waiver claim, they will move to last in the waiver order for their tier until the next waiver update. 4.2.6 Waiver periods for players end every Tuesday at 11:59pm EST and Thursday at 11:59pm EST. 4.2.6.1 If a player is cut between Friday and Tuesday, their waiver will end on the coming Thursday. 4.2.6.2 If a player is cut on a Wednesday or Thursday, their waiver will end on the following Tuesday. 4.2.7 The waiver order before the first update, after Match Day 3, will be the inverse of the draft order in each individual tier. This order is set with the draft lottery and ignores any trading of picks. 4.2.8 Players may not decline being signed during the waiver period in order to sign with another franchise. 4.2.8.1 If a player attempts to do this, they will be made an RFA until 2 match days following the date their waiver period was set to end, where they will become a Free Agent eligible to sign with any franchise. 4.3 General Trading Regulations 4.3.1 Trades should be executed in good faith. This means trades should show an obvious benefit to both parties. Any abuse of the trading system may result in trading sanctions on the franchise, imposed by Admins or Transaction Managers. 4.3.2 If there is reasonable doubt that a General Manager will not return in the following season, or is trading away an excessive amount of future draft picks, Admins may vote to remove rights to trading from a franchise. 4.3.2.1 All Admins must vote. 4.3.2.2 The franchise may not trade while the vote is ongoing. 4.3.2.3 The vote must be completed within 48 hours of the issue being brought to attention. 4.3.2.3 In the event there is no majority in the vote, the franchise will retain their rights to trade. 4.3.2.4 If the vote fails, another vote that targets the same franchise cannot be called until at least 4 match days have passed. 4.3.3 Admins and Transaction Managers have the right to deny any trades. Generally, this right will only be exercised in situations where trades are very one sided or a franchise is being taken advantage of. This requires discussion between Admins and TMs, and will not involve anyone with a strong conflict of interests. 4.3.4 Before the draft for a season, transactions will be temporarily opened to allow franchises to re-sign players, freely make roster changes, and trade with other franchises. This offseason transaction period will open after numbers lock and close a few days before the draft begins. 4.3.4.1 During the draft, franchises may trade draft picks and players that have yet to be drafted with a keeper pick. Franchises may not trade players that were drafted in that season's draft, including players kept from the previous season. 4.4 Cross Tier Trading 4.4.1 Sometimes, trades between tiers will be restricted. This is solely determined by the difference in number of teams between franchises. When trades between tiers are restricted, franchises may not trade players or draft picks for players or draft picks in a different tier. Cross tier trades are fully unrestricted when either all franchises have the same number of teams, or all franchises have 4 or more teams. 4.4.1.1 This applies even if the trade includes parts that are in the same tier. Trades in different tiers between the same franchises may be submitted at the same time as long as each trade is mutually beneficial. 4.4.2 Cross tier trades are restricted when: 4.4.2.1 Franchises have 1 team and other franchises have 2. 4.4.2.2 Franchises have 2 teams and other franchises have 3 or 4. 4.4.2.3 Franchises have 3 teams and other franchises have 5. 4.4.3 One cross tier trade will be allowed per franchise, per season, in the following scenarios: 4.4.3.1 Franchises have 3 teams and other franchises have 4. 4.5 Future Pick Trades 4.5.1 During a season, only draft picks for the next draft may be traded. During the offseason transaction period, draft picks for the upcoming draft and next draft may be traded. 4.5.1.1 Example: During season 2, only draft picks for the season 3 draft can be traded. During the offseason transaction period prior to the season 3 draft, draft picks for the season 3 and 4 drafts can be traded. The following draft pick trade rules are in place to protect new GMs from being left with too few picks, prevent franchises from stacking one team at the expense of another, and minimize abuse in trading. 4.5.2 When trading draft picks for the upcoming draft during the offseason transaction period: 4.5.2.1 All teams must retain one 1st or 2nd round draft pick, or have 3 picks between the 3rd and 4th rounds. 4.5.2.2 All teams must retain at least 3 picks between round 1 and the last complete round. The last complete round will be recorded as of 48 hours prior to the closing of offseason transactions. 4.5.3 When trading draft picks for the next season during the offseason transaction period or during the regular season: 4.5.3.1 Only 1st through 5th round picks may be traded, as picks in the 6th round and beyond are not guaranteed. 4.5.3.2 All teams must retain one 1st or 2nd round draft pick, or have 2 picks in the 3rd round. 4.5.3.3 All teams must retain at least two picks between the 3rd, 4th, and 5th rounds unless they have two picks in the first 2 rounds. 4.5.3.4 All teams must retain at least 3 draft picks between rounds 1 and 5. 4.6 Substitutions 4.6.1 If a team will be missing 1 or 2 players for a match day, they may get a Free Agent or RFA to fill in as long as MMR cap requirements are fulfilled. 4.6.1.1 Teams may not use more than 2 substitutes in one match. They should instead look to reschedule the match. 4.6.2 Free Agents and RFAs may substitute in a higher tier if they agree to do so. 4.6.2.1 Teams in higher tiers may not look for a substitute from a lower tier until 2 hours before the match is scheduled to begin. 4.6.3 Players rostered in a franchise are allowed to substitute for a team in a higher tier within their franchise. 4.6.4 Players may not sub down to a team in a lower tier for any reason. 4.6.5 Players, whether on a roster or not, may not play for more than one team in one match day. 4.6.5.1 If a match on Friday, Match Day 6, is rescheduled for Saturday, the player may not substitute for a team in that match if they played on a team during the regularly scheduled matches on Friday, Match Day 6. 4.6.6 Once submitted by a franchise, a player may not back out of an agreement to substitute. 4.6.6.1 A player on a team in a lower tier in the franchise may be relieved of their obligation to substitute if another is found prior to the transaction deadline. 4.6.6.2 If a Free Agent/RFA backs out of subbing without good reason, they will be moved to RFA if they are a Free Agent and will be barred from subbing for the next 6 match days. 4.6.7 Once agreed to, a franchise must roster a player that has committed to subbing for them. 4.6.8 Some aspects of substitutions are handled differently in the postseason. 4.6.8.1Substitutions are allowed before map 1 or between other maps. Subs must be declared prior to the pistol round. If the request for a substitute was made during the knife round, the knife round must be played out. 4.6.8.2 If a Transaction Manager is unavailable to officially process a transaction, the substitute may still be used. If the substitute was invalid for any reason, all maps the substitute played in will be retroactively forfeited. 4.6.8.3 Players may substitute in a higher tier no more than once, in each tier, during the postseason even if only for one map. 4.6.8.4 Players may not substitute in another tier on the same match night, but may substitute during the same round in another tier. 4.6.8.4.1 Example: a player may play in the Championship in their own tier on a Wednesday, and a Championship in a higher tier on Friday. 4.6.8.5 A player may not switch teams during concurrently-running matches. 4.7 Cuts 4.7.1 Players may be cut from their team at any time for any reason. 4.7.2 Cut players who are not picked up on waivers will become uncontracted Free Agents. 4.7.2.1 Refer to the Waivers section for more information on the waiver system. 4.7.3 A cut player cannot be picked up by the same team until after the match day following their waiver period ending. 4.7.4 All players must play in 2 maps after being signed or drafted before they may be cut or traded, including pre-season. 4.7.4.1 The maps played must be in regular matches and not scrims, whether they are on a match night or not. 4.7.4.2 Refusing to roster a player under this rule despite their willingness and ability to play will incur punishment. 4.7.4.3 If a player is unable to play in a match before pre-season cuts are due, they may be cut if proof of unresponsiveness or unavailability is provided by a franchise. 4.8 Promotion/Demotion 4.8.1 Players may be promoted at any time, before the draft or during a season, as long as they agree. 4.8.2 If a player is promoted before the draft, they can not be demoted unless they are cut. 4.8.2.1 If they are cut, they will begin their waiver period in the tier they were in prior to being promoted. 4.8.2.2 After being demoted, players must wait 2 match days past their waiver period ending to sign with the franchise they were cut from in their original tier. 4.8.2.3 If a player is promoted before the draft and cut in the preseason, they must sign for a different franchise. They may not return to their original franchise until the next season. This is to prevent franchises dodging early round keeper picks. 4.8.3 If a player is promoted after the draft, they will remain on the team they were promoted to unless they are cut or demoted. 4.8.3.1 Players may be demoted without restriction if they are promoted after the draft. 4.8.4 Players can only be demoted one tier each match day. 4.8.5 Franchises must cut or IR a player in the higher tier in order to promote or demote a player if there is not already a roster slot open. 4.8.6 Promoted or relegated players are available to play in the next match, as long as the transaction is submitted at least 30 minutes prior to the match. 4.8.7 If a promoted player is traded, they retain their contract and must stay in the tier they were promoted to. 4.8.7.1 The new franchise is free to demote the player at any time. Section 5. Free Agency 5.1 Free Agents 5.1.1 Free Agents have the option to choose which franchise to join if multiple franchises make offers, as long as they are not on waivers. They can choose to decline all offers to remain a Free Agent. 5.1.1.1 If the Free Agent is on waivers, they must follow rule 4.2.8. 5.1.2 Free Agents may agree to a one match temporary contract (a substitution) with a franchise. The MMR of the Free Agent replaces the missing player on the team they are substituting for, and must fit in the MMR cap restrictions. 5.1.2.1 If a Free Agent gets multiple requests to substitute for teams, they are allowed to choose which team they sub for. They may also decline all offers with no consequences. 5.1.2.2 Reminder: Once a player and franchise agree that the player will substitute, they may not back out without consequence and the franchise must roster the player that match day. 5.1.3 RFAs can be moved to Free Agency if the need arises. More info in the next section. 5.1.4 Every 4th match day prior to the playoff roster lock, all Free Agents will be pinged in the Discord. Any who do not respond by the next Tuesday will be marked as inactive and removed from the league. If they return, they can DM an Admin and will return to the FA pool on waivers. 5.2 Restricted Free Agents 5.2.1 Any players that sign up for the league after the draft will enter as a Permanent Free Agent (this has been, and will continue to be, referred to as \"RFA\"). 5.2.2 Generally, RFAs are identical to Free Agents. There are 2 key differences. 5.2.2.1 RFAs can not sub for the same franchise 2 match days in a row. For example, RFAs can substitute for a franchise on match days 4 and 6, but not match days 4 and 5. 5.2.2.2 RFAs can not permanently sign with a franchise. 5.2.3 RFAs have the option to return to the league the next season as a Draft Eligible. If the player wants to remain an RFA due to availability, they should fill out the Intent form as not returning and sign up for RFA when the form goes out. 5.2.4 If at some point during the season the Admins feel that there is a lack of regular free agents for a specific tier, they can promote permanent free agents to regular free agent status to return free agent numbers to an ideal amount. 5.2.4.1 The permanent free agent(s) to be promoted will be determined based on the date and time in which the permanent free agent(s) signed up for the league, with those that signed up earliest being selected first . 5.2.5 RFAs may be moved to regular Free Agency if a tier is in need of Free Agents. 5.2.5.1 During a season, if a tier drops below 0.75 Free Agents per team in the tier, Admins may elect to move RFAs. This is not a set number, and Admins are free to move players to Free Agency if they feel the move is the best option for the health of the tier. 5.2.5.2 RFAs will be asked if they want to move to Free Agent in the order their RFA applications were received. 5.2.5.3 RFAs will be moved until all available RFAs have been moved/requested to remain RFA, or the number of Free Agents per team is greater than 1.5. 5.2.5.4 In order to be moved, RFAs need to have applied for Permanent Free Agency prior to the match day the tier was confirmed to have too few Free Agents per team. 5.2.5.5 RFAs moved to Free Agency will enter there on waivers. 5.2.5.6 Once the season is more than 75% completed, RFAs will no longer be moved to Free Agency, regardless of the number of available Free Agents. Section 6. Game Rules, Lobbies 6.1 Match Setup Regulations 6.1.1 For each regular season match day,two maps will be played. Each match will be between two teams. In the playoffs, a Best of 3 will be played. 6.1.2 League matches will be played on the most up-to-date patch for all game settings including any and all weapon buffs and nerfs, even if the patch takes place mid-season. This does not include an updated map pool. 6.1.3 League matches will only be played on the 7 maps chosen at the beginning of the season, which is defined by the conclusion of the draft. These maps are currently: 6.1.3.1 Fracture 6.1.3.2 Breeze 6.1.3.3 Icebox 6.1.3.4 Bind 6.1.3.5 Split 6.1.3.6 Ascent 6.1.3.7 Haven 6.1.4 Unless Riot indefinitely removes one of the 7 chosen maps from the game, our pool will remain as is until the following season. 6.1.5 When a new agent is added, they may not be used until the match day 14 days after the patch in which they are introduced. 6.1.5.1 This rule only applies between the draft and the last Championship game of the season. 6.1.6 Spectators are allowed to be in voice comms with teams during a match if a player wants to stream their match to a friend, for example. Spectators are NOT allowed to communicate with the players. If a team is found to have someone who is not playing in the match provide any coaching or other assistance during a match, the match may be retroactively forfeited. 6.2 Game Setup 6.2.1 VDC uses Valorant custom game servers for matches. 6.2.1.1 Matches should be played on Chicago servers by default, unless both teams agree on another server location. 6.2.2 The captain of the home team should create the lobby, friend the opposing captain, and ensure all players on both teams end up in the match. 6.2.3 Game settings should be as follows: 6.2.3.1 Allow Cheats: Off 6.2.3.2 Tournament Mode: On 6.2.3.3 Overtime Win By 2: On 6.2.3.4 Play Out All Rounds: Off 6.2.3.5 Hide Match History: Off 6.2.4 The two maps in a match will be determined by a veto system using mapban.gg. 6.2.4.1 The home team captain will make the mapban.gg lobby and provide the Team 1 link to the away team captain. 6.2.4.2 The order for map vetoes is: Home Ban, Away Ban, Home Ban, Away Ban, Home Pick, Away Pick. 6.2.4.3 Teams choose whether they start Attacking or Defending on their opponents map pick. 6.2.5 If servers go down or are restarted due to an error on Riot's end, the outcomes of any completed halves or pistol rounds should be duplicated as accurately as possible. 6.2.6 If Allow Cheats is left on and a team misuses any part of it, whether intentional or not, the map will be forfeited 0-13. Player stats will not be recorded. 6.2.6.1 If it is clear that a cheat being used was accidental (ex. A player accidentally hitting their Ghost keybind but immediately disabling it with no further incident), no punishment will be incurred and the match can play on as normal. 6.2.7 Teams are allowed up to a 5 minute break between map 1 and map 2 while the lobby is being created and prepared. 6.2.7.1 If all 5 players on a team are not back in the lobby after 5 minutes, a DM should be sent to their captain. After another 5 minutes, the map will be forfeited. 6.2.8 The home team captain is obligated to have the lobby created and set up within 5 minutes of the match start time. The away team captain is obligated to have their team joining the lobby no later than the scheduled match start time. If either obligation is breached, a DM should be sent to the captain not following their duties 5 minutes after the scheduled match start time. 6.2.8.1 10 minutes after the DM is sent, if no valid and verifiable reason is given for the delay, map 1 will be forfeited. 6.2.8.2 15 minutes after the DM is sent, if no valid and verifiable reason is given for the delay, map 2 will be forfeited. 6.3 Playoff Game Setup 6.3.1 Game settings, lobby setup, and delay rules are identical to the regular season. Map vetoes and breaks are handled differently. 6.3.2 During playoffs, the better seeded team will choose whether they veto first or second. The order is as follows: veto-veto, pick-pick, veto-veto, with one map remaining. One team selects their starting side on their opponent's map pick. 6.3.2.1 In map 3, change the \"Allow Cheats\" option to ON. Side selection will be determined by a knife round. 6.3.2.2 After the knife round is completed, teams should use the cheat menu in game to swap teams if necessary and change agents if they wish. After this, the cheat menu should not be used. 6.3.3 If a player misuses any part of the cheat menu, intentionally or not, map 3 will be forfeited by the misusing team and the series is over. Player stats will not be recorded. 6.3.4 For Playoff matches, games beyond the first game have a break period of up to 10 minutes. If one team is not ready at that point, the team that is ready may ping the opposing captain and GM. Once that ping is made, the unready team has 5 minutes to become ready. If they are still not ready, that game is forfeited by the unready team. A substitution or remake of the game will reset all of these timers. 6.4 Bugs and Exploits 6.4.1 Intentional use of any bugs, glitches, exploits, or any other unintended actions is not allowed. Upon receiving a report that a bug was used, Admins will review any available evidence and make a ruling. Admins may award map wins, match wins, and/or levy punishments on the players who break this rule if it is determined that use of the bug impacted the outcome of a map or match. 6.4.2 General examples of things that are not allowed: Moving on, under, or through any areas that are not intended by the map design (any walls, ceilings, floors, etc). The spike can not be placed in an area it can not be defused, or in an area where the Spike does not make any sound. However, it is okay to use Sage walls to block the bomb or secure it in a certain area (such as in the cubby on Icebox B site). Boosting on top of teammates is not allowed when it allows players to see through solid objects or remove textures to give an unfair advantage. Boosting on top of a teammate is otherwise allowed. Pixel walking is forbidden. A player will be considered to be pixel walking if they sit or stand on invisible pixels on the map, where there is no visible edge (such as using Jett updrafts to land on a high up invisible ledge) 6.4.3 It is recommended to check with Admins to find out whether or not a certain bug or glitch is considered legal. Admins reserve the right to make changes, even retroactively, to this list, and rule use of bugs on a case by case basis. 6.5 Pauses and Disconnects 6.5.1 If a player disconnects mid-game, they are allowed to join back as soon as possible. 6.5.2 Teams are allowed to pause when one of their players disconnects or has a technical issue. This should be done using the Pause Match Timer option in the Cheats menu made available by Tournament Mode. 6.5.2.1 When a tech pause is called, the opposing captain should record the time. 6.5.2.2 Teams are allowed to pause for technical issues 2 times per match. Each pause may, but is not required to, last up to 5 minutes. If the first tech pause goes over 5 minutes, the team loses their right to a second tech pause. 6.5.2.3 If the tech issue has not been solved 9 minutes after the pause begins, your captain should warn the opponents in the game chat that they have 1 minute remaining. After this minute passes, the game must be unpaused. Further unreasonable delay may result in a match forfeit. 6.5.3 If a disconnect occurs in a round where the game is won by either team, the match result stands. 6.6 Game Results 6.6.1 The captain of the team that won map 2 should report the score in the proper discord channel. The score report should contain: The series score, the score of each map, the name of each map, and a tracker.gg link to each map. 6.6.2 Scores should be reported in the score reporting channels for the respective tier the match was played in. 6.6.3 For the purpose of tiebreakers, an OT result will be scored 14-12. Season Overview Section 7. Offseason 7.1 Combines 7.1.1 Combines are the first event in each VDC season. In combines, players join lobbies with 9 other VDC players, franchise representatives, and players scouting. 7.1.2 Every VDC player must play in 3 VDC combine matches to qualify for the draft. Outside of that, combines are not required. 7.2 The Draft 7.2.1 The next big event in VDC is the draft. In the draft, every single registered player will be drafted to a team. 7.2.1.1 The draft is a snake draft where, ignoring trades, the franchise that picks first in a round picks last in the next round. 7.2.2 The draft is divided by tier. Players are drafted in the tier they are in at the end of combines. 7.2.3 Franchises who wish to keep a player from a previous season must use a \"Keeper Pick\", the round of which is determined by MMR, to draft them. A keeper pick is a regular draft pick, but instead of drafting a new player the pick is used to keep an already rostered player. 7.2.3.1 If a franchise has more than 1 player requiring a keeper pick in the same round, a better pick must be used unless they trade for another pick in that round. 7.3 Draft Lottery 7.3.1 The draft order is decided by a lottery before offseason transactions open. Each tier has its own lottery. The odds for each team will be determined by two factors as follows: 7.3.1.1 The regular season win rate. 7.3.1.2 Postseason placement score. Elimination in the first round will get a score of 1, second round a score of 2, etc. The runner up will get a score of Semifinal + 1, and the Champion will get a score of Semifinal + 1.5. 7.3.1.3 Lottery Score is calculated with the following formula: (Regular Season Win Rate * 0.70) + (Postseason Placement Score * 0.30). All lottery scores in a tier will be added, and each team will have their odds set to (Team Lottery Score / Tier Total Lottery Score) 7.3.2 When a new tier is added, every team will have the same lottery odds. 7.3.3 If a tier adds new teams equal to, or greater than, the total number of teams in the tier the previous season, draft lottery odds will all be equal regardless of previous season results. Section 8. Preseason 8.1.1 The preseason has 3 matches, during which teams figure out who the final 5 players on their roster will be. During these 3 matches, rosters will need to get closer to 5 as follows 8.1.1.1 Teams must be down to 6 or fewer rostered players the day after the second preseason match at Noon EST. 8.1.1.2 Teams must have no more and no less than 5 rostered players the day after the third preseason match at Noon EST. 8.1.2 All players that are drafted must play in at least 1 preseason match before they are cut. This does not include scrims. A player who does not reply, does not join the franchise discord, or is unavailable for matches may be cut without playing a match. Proof of these will be required. Section 9. Regular Season 9.1 Rescheduling 9.1.1 In the regular season, all teams in a tier fight for the best playoff positions over many weeks of games. 9.1.2 Matches may be rescheduled if teams agree on a new date and time. A match can be rescheduled to any time between the day after the prior match day and 6 days after the originally scheduled date (1 day before the second next match day). Reschedules must be clearly communicated to Admins in transaction channels. Score reports should specify which match the result is for if the match was rescheduled. 9.1.2.1 If a team is unable to make the rescheduled time, they will forfeit the match. 9.1.2.2 Match reschedules may be submitted at any time and scheduled to be played at any time before the next match day's originally scheduled match time, given both teams agree to play on that date. 9.1.2.3 If the match is rescheduled, the new match time will be treated as equivalent to the original match time for the purposes of all rules contained in this document. 9.1.2.4 Exceptions to these rules may be made in special circumstances, message an Admin if you need to reschedule outside of the allowed period. 9.2 Tiebreakers 9.2.1 If two or more teams have the same regular season record, ties between the teams will be resolved using the following tiebreakers: 9.2.1.1 Head to Head Record 9.2.1.2 Head to Head Round Differential 9.2.1.3 Overall Round Win Percentage 9.2.1.4 (Optional) GM 1v1 on a game of their choice 9.2.1.5 Coin Flip 9.2.2 If there is a tie between 3 or more teams, tiebreakers will be resolved by going down the list and removing teams with a defined advantage or disadvantage in a category. 9.2.2.1 Head to Head is broken by combining all wins and losses, regardless of who they are against. For example, Team A, Team B, Team C, and Team D are in a 4 way tie. Between them, Team A is 5-1, Teams B and C are 3-3, and Team D is 1-5. Team A takes first in the tiebreaker and Team D takes 4th. Teams B and C tied their H2H matchup 1-1. Teams B and C advance to the next tiebreaker. 9.2.2.2 Head to Head Round Differential is now the tiebreaker. Team B beat Team C on Bind 12-6. Team C beat Team B on Split 12-10. Team B has the better round differential (+6 \\> +2), so they win the tiebreaker. 9.2.2.3 Say Team C had also won 12-6. Now they move to Overall Round Win Percentage. This factors back in every match the teams have played this season (Season Rounds Won / Season Rounds Played). Whoever is higher takes 2nd! Section 10. Playoffs and Beyond 10.1 General Playoff Info 10.1.1 Playoff seeding is determined by regular season standings. 10.1.2 During the postseason, the better seed is the home team, and will decide whether they want to veto first or second. 10.1.3 Playoff rounds, with the exception of the Championship game, will be Best of 3. The Championship to crown the champion of a tier will be a Best of 5. 10.1.3.1 Scheduling rules do not apply for Championship matches. Teams will be given a range of dates to schedule the match. If a time is not agreed upon, the match will be defaulted to, in order if in the date range given: Wednesday, then Friday, then Saturday, then Monday. 10.1.4 The Tier Championship will be set up similar to the rest of the playoffs with a Best of 3 structure. 10.1.5 Playoff format itself can vary based on the number of teams in a tier, detailed below. 10.2 Playoff Format 10.2.1 With 4 or 6 teams, there will be a 4 team playoff. 1 vs 4, 2 vs 3. 10.2.2 With 8, 10, 12, 14, or 16 teams, there will be a 6 team playoff. Seeds 1 and 2 get a bye. The bracket will be reseeded after the first round of games. 10.2.3 These may change season by season, and exceptions may be made. Admins will announce the playoff formats each season as they are decided. Major Rule Change Process Stage 1: The Community At the end of the season, a discord channel will be opened for players to: Mention which rules caused problems Highlight rules that impacted how smoothly the league operated Suggest rules that did not exist, that players think should exist Suggest changes or additions to existing rules Stage 2: Administration Admins take the community suggestions and polish them to fit the style of the rulebook, assign rule numbers for if the rule is accepted, and assign a Proposal number to the suggested change. They may also add their own proposals. Admins may veto community rules if they, despite popular support, go against the ideals of the league. Stage 3: Proposal Voting Any players that participated in the last season will be eligible to vote on all proposals in a form sent out in the Announcement channel. At the same time, Admins and Team Leads will vote separately. Stage 4: Vote Tallying The result of the community vote will be weighted at 70%. The result of the Admin vote will be weighted at 30%. A 2/3 vote in favor of the proposal is necessary for the proposal to pass. Vote percentages will be posted to announcements. Stage 4.1: Split Voting A vote of exactly 2/3 in favor of a proposal will result in the proposal failing Glossary of Terms A.

The link to join is https://discord.gg/vdc 2.1.1.1 Leaving the Discord can lead to a one or more season ban from VDC, ruled on a case by case basis depending on various factors such as time into the season, duration of departure, league tenure, past punishment record, and more. 2.1.2 Sign up using the form in the #sign-ups channel in the Discord. If you fill it out incompletely or incorrectly, an Admin will contact you to fix the error before you are added to the draft pool. 2.1.2.1 Players that were a part of the prior season will receive an Intent form that they should fill out instead of the signup form. 2.1.2.2 Any and all accounts used to play Valorant should be reported on the signup form.

When the rules mention promotion, this refers to players moving from lower tiers to higher ones. When the rules mention demotion, this refers to players moving from higher tiers to lower tiers. 3.1.1.1 Tiers will not be added or removed in the middle of a season. 3.1.1.2 Tiers may be added or removed during combines. Changes like this will be accompanied by an announcement in Discord. 3.1.2 Each franchise has at most one team per tier. Teams themselves do not move between tiers, but players may move between teams in different tiers. 3.1.3 Players can not move between tiers during a season, unless they are promoted by their General Manager. 3.1.4 Every tier has matches scheduled on the same days at the same time, with the exception of some playoff matches. 3.1.4.1 Matches will be scheduled on Wednesdays and Fridays, but may not be scheduled around major holidays. 3.1.4.2 Matches are scheduled to start at 9pm EST. 3.2 General Manager Rules 3.2.1 General Managers are selected by the Admins from players that have applied. 3.2.1.1 GMs are not required to play in the league. 3.2.1.2 GMs are selected based on a variety of factors including seasons in the league, AGM experience, punishment history, and past experiences outside VDC. 3.2.2 GMs are permitted to cut themselves from their team at any time post draft, if they wish. A GM who does this will not become a Free Agent. 3.2.2.1 A GM who wishes to return to their roster must treat this transaction the same as if they were picking up a Free Agent. 3.2.2.2 A GM can return to their roster in place of a player placed on IR. 3.2.2.3 A GM can not return to their roster temporarily as a substitute. 3.2.2.4 A GM can not substitute in a higher tier if they are not a part of a roster in their franchise. 3.3 Assistant General Managers 3.3.1 General Managers may appoint Assistant General Managers to help with franchise operations. These players must be approved for the position in a majority vote by Admins. There is a maximum number of AGM's allowed per franchise. 3.3.1.1 Currently, until all franchises have at least 3-4 teams (meaning we have 3-4 tiers), all franchises will only be allowed 1 AGM. 3.3.2 Each season, a franchise is allowed to switch AGM one time per AGM their franchise is allowed. For example, if a franchise is allowed one AGM by rule, they are allowed one switch of who is AGM per season. The switches restock the day GM changes are announced. 3.3.2.1 If a franchise takes over midseason, they are allowed to switch any AGMs one time, without using their allotted switches. 3.3.2.2 If a franchise has less than their allotted AGMs, appointing an AGM to reach the limit does not count as a switch. 3.3.2.3 An AGM stepping down due to leaving the league or leaving a franchise will count as a new AGM being appointed, not an AGM switch. 3.4 Player Contracts 3.4.1 When a player is drafted or signed from free agency, they enter a 2 season contract. 3.4.1.1 If the season is in progress when the player is signed, the season counts as season 1 of 2, regardless of how far into the season the signing occurs. 3.4.2 Players may not choose to leave a team while under contract, but may request to be cut or traded, subject to their GM's approval. 3.4.2.1 If a player is cut for refusing to play for their team, they will be suspended for half of the number of total matches in the season (rounded up) or until the match day following roster lock if the season is more than halfway completed. They will become an RFA after this time. 3.4.3 Contracts are tracked by season, not by week. 3.4.3.1 All contracts in a tier will be reduced by 1 season the day following the Championship match day for that tier. 3.4.4 Between seasons, player tiers move around and franchises are reassigned what tiers they have teams in. 3.4.4.1 If a player is promoted to a tier where their current franchise does not have a team, they will immediately become a Free Agent. 3.4.4.2 If a franchise loses a team in a tier they currently have players in, all players will immediately become Free Agents. 3.4.4.3 If a team moves from one franchise to another due to reassignments, the new franchise will take over all existing contracts. 3.4.5 When a contract ends, a player may agree to sign for an additional season if the GM invites them to do so. The number of contract extensions a player may make is not limited. 3.4.5.1 If the player does not renew their contract with a franchise they can not sign with that franchise until 2 match days have passed, including pre-season. 3.4.5.2 If they do not renew the contract by the contract renewal deadline they become a regular free agent, skipping waivers, and can be signed or drafted. 3.4.6 A player may agree to go on \"Inactive Reserve'' (IR) in the event they need to take an extended break. This allows the franchise to indefinitely replace them while keeping the rights to roster them once they return. 3.4.6.1 This break must last a minimum of 4 match days. 3.4.6.2 The MMR of the 6th player replaces the MMR of the player on IR. MMR cap rules still apply. 3.4.6.3 A player on IR is not allowed to play any matches until they are taken off IR. 3.5 Roster Rules 3.5.1 Rosters have a set number of players they must have. Rosters are by team, not by franchise. 3.5.2 Teams can not have more than 5 players, with two exceptions. 3.5.2.1 Between the draft and the first pre-season cut day, roster sizes are unlimited. 3.5.2.2 If a team puts a player on IR, they may add one extra rostered player. 3.5.3 Teams can not have less than 5 rostered players, unless poor draft planning results in fewer than 5 draft picks. In this case, a Free Agent must be picked up by the roster lock date. 3.5.4 Teams will still be allowed to play in a match should a team suffer a player loss outside of their control in the season, resulting in having 4 active players. 3.5.4.1 The roster should be back up to 5 players by the next match day, whether the missing player is cut or put on IR. 3.5.4.2 The only transactions allowed for such teams are signing Free Agents and promoting from a lower tier. 3.5.4.3 The MMR of the player or players lost is still active against the tier MMR cap until a replacement player or players are found. 3.6 MMR Caps 3.6.1 Each team has an MMR cap. Every team in a tier has the same cap. 3.6.2 The caps are adjusted at the beginning of every season, prior to the draft. 3.6.3 Each team must remain at or below their cap. Teams are not allowed to exceed their caps at any point, except during the period between the end of the previous season's playoffs and the Roster Lock following the current season's draft. 3.6.4 Re-signed players must stay on a roster through the draft. They cannot be cut anytime prior to the draft. They can be cut after the draft in the preseason and would then be placed on waivers. The waivers will follow the standard waiver rules. Waivers will be the inverse of draft order. Re-signed players cannot be traded until two match days have passed.","title":"Section 3. General Operational Info"},{"location":"#section-4-transactions","text":"4.1 General Transaction Rules 4.1.1 The season transaction deadline is one match day before the Playoffs begin, 30 minutes before that match begins. 4.1.1.1 Teams may only use 1 substitute player each match day following the season transaction deadline. 4.1.2 For a match day transaction to be processed for the current match day, it must be submitted 30 minutes before the match is scheduled to begin. 4.1.3 Transactions posted less than 30 minutes before a match is scheduled to begin will be handled as follows: 4.1.3.1 Substitution requests will be invalidated. 4.1.3.2 Trades, cuts, and signings will be made official for the next match day. 4.2 Waivers 4.2.1 VDC utilizes waivers to allow some teams to have a claim on players before others. Contracted players who are cut will go through a waiver period where they can be picked up by another team. 4.2.2 Players signed from waivers will retain the contract they had with their old franchise, and will not be given a fresh 2 season contract. 4.2.3 The waiver order is determined by tier, not the league as a whole. 4.2.4 Players can only be claimed from waivers to play for a team in the tier their waiver belongs to. 4.2.5 The waiver order is determined by the inverse of team standings, with the worst team in a tier getting the first waiver claim and the best team in a tier getting the last waiver claim. 4.2.5.1 The waiver order is updated on every 3rd match day, beginning Match Day 3. 4.2.5.2 When a team makes a waiver claim, they will move to last in the waiver order for their tier until the next waiver update. 4.2.6 Waiver periods for players end every Tuesday at 11:59pm EST and Thursday at 11:59pm EST. 4.2.6.1 If a player is cut between Friday and Tuesday, their waiver will end on the coming Thursday. 4.2.6.2 If a player is cut on a Wednesday or Thursday, their waiver will end on the following Tuesday. 4.2.7 The waiver order before the first update, after Match Day 3, will be the inverse of the draft order in each individual tier. This order is set with the draft lottery and ignores any trading of picks. 4.2.8 Players may not decline being signed during the waiver period in order to sign with another franchise. 4.2.8.1 If a player attempts to do this, they will be made an RFA until 2 match days following the date their waiver period was set to end, where they will become a Free Agent eligible to sign with any franchise. 4.3 General Trading Regulations 4.3.1 Trades should be executed in good faith. This means trades should show an obvious benefit to both parties. Any abuse of the trading system may result in trading sanctions on the franchise, imposed by Admins or Transaction Managers. 4.3.2 If there is reasonable doubt that a General Manager will not return in the following season, or is trading away an excessive amount of future draft picks, Admins may vote to remove rights to trading from a franchise. 4.3.2.1 All Admins must vote. 4.3.2.2 The franchise may not trade while the vote is ongoing. 4.3.2.3 The vote must be completed within 48 hours of the issue being brought to attention. 4.3.2.3 In the event there is no majority in the vote, the franchise will retain their rights to trade. 4.3.2.4 If the vote fails, another vote that targets the same franchise cannot be called until at least 4 match days have passed. 4.3.3 Admins and Transaction Managers have the right to deny any trades. Generally, this right will only be exercised in situations where trades are very one sided or a franchise is being taken advantage of. This requires discussion between Admins and TMs, and will not involve anyone with a strong conflict of interests. 4.3.4 Before the draft for a season, transactions will be temporarily opened to allow franchises to re-sign players, freely make roster changes, and trade with other franchises. This offseason transaction period will open after numbers lock and close a few days before the draft begins. 4.3.4.1 During the draft, franchises may trade draft picks and players that have yet to be drafted with a keeper pick. Franchises may not trade players that were drafted in that season's draft, including players kept from the previous season. 4.4 Cross Tier Trading 4.4.1 Sometimes, trades between tiers will be restricted. This is solely determined by the difference in number of teams between franchises. When trades between tiers are restricted, franchises may not trade players or draft picks for players or draft picks in a different tier. Cross tier trades are fully unrestricted when either all franchises have the same number of teams, or all franchises have 4 or more teams. 4.4.1.1 This applies even if the trade includes parts that are in the same tier. Trades in different tiers between the same franchises may be submitted at the same time as long as each trade is mutually beneficial. 4.4.2 Cross tier trades are restricted when: 4.4.2.1 Franchises have 1 team and other franchises have 2. 4.4.2.2 Franchises have 2 teams and other franchises have 3 or 4. 4.4.2.3 Franchises have 3 teams and other franchises have 5. 4.4.3 One cross tier trade will be allowed per franchise, per season, in the following scenarios: 4.4.3.1 Franchises have 3 teams and other franchises have 4. 4.5 Future Pick Trades 4.5.1 During a season, only draft picks for the next draft may be traded. During the offseason transaction period, draft picks for the upcoming draft and next draft may be traded. 4.5.1.1 Example: During season 2, only draft picks for the season 3 draft can be traded. During the offseason transaction period prior to the season 3 draft, draft picks for the season 3 and 4 drafts can be traded. The following draft pick trade rules are in place to protect new GMs from being left with too few picks, prevent franchises from stacking one team at the expense of another, and minimize abuse in trading. 4.5.2 When trading draft picks for the upcoming draft during the offseason transaction period: 4.5.2.1 All teams must retain one 1st or 2nd round draft pick, or have 3 picks between the 3rd and 4th rounds. 4.5.2.2 All teams must retain at least 3 picks between round 1 and the last complete round. The last complete round will be recorded as of 48 hours prior to the closing of offseason transactions. 4.5.3 When trading draft picks for the next season during the offseason transaction period or during the regular season: 4.5.3.1 Only 1st through 5th round picks may be traded, as picks in the 6th round and beyond are not guaranteed. 4.5.3.2 All teams must retain one 1st or 2nd round draft pick, or have 2 picks in the 3rd round. 4.5.3.3 All teams must retain at least two picks between the 3rd, 4th, and 5th rounds unless they have two picks in the first 2 rounds. 4.5.3.4 All teams must retain at least 3 draft picks between rounds 1 and 5. 4.6 Substitutions 4.6.1 If a team will be missing 1 or 2 players for a match day, they may get a Free Agent or RFA to fill in as long as MMR cap requirements are fulfilled. 4.6.1.1 Teams may not use more than 2 substitutes in one match. They should instead look to reschedule the match. 4.6.2 Free Agents and RFAs may substitute in a higher tier if they agree to do so. 4.6.2.1 Teams in higher tiers may not look for a substitute from a lower tier until 2 hours before the match is scheduled to begin. 4.6.3 Players rostered in a franchise are allowed to substitute for a team in a higher tier within their franchise. 4.6.4 Players may not sub down to a team in a lower tier for any reason. 4.6.5 Players, whether on a roster or not, may not play for more than one team in one match day. 4.6.5.1 If a match on Friday, Match Day 6, is rescheduled for Saturday, the player may not substitute for a team in that match if they played on a team during the regularly scheduled matches on Friday, Match Day 6. 4.6.6 Once submitted by a franchise, a player may not back out of an agreement to substitute. 4.6.6.1 A player on a team in a lower tier in the franchise may be relieved of their obligation to substitute if another is found prior to the transaction deadline. 4.6.6.2 If a Free Agent/RFA backs out of subbing without good reason, they will be moved to RFA if they are a Free Agent and will be barred from subbing for the next 6 match days. 4.6.7 Once agreed to, a franchise must roster a player that has committed to subbing for them. 4.6.8 Some aspects of substitutions are handled differently in the postseason. 4.6.8.1Substitutions are allowed before map 1 or between other maps. Subs must be declared prior to the pistol round. If the request for a substitute was made during the knife round, the knife round must be played out. 4.6.8.2 If a Transaction Manager is unavailable to officially process a transaction, the substitute may still be used. If the substitute was invalid for any reason, all maps the substitute played in will be retroactively forfeited. 4.6.8.3 Players may substitute in a higher tier no more than once, in each tier, during the postseason even if only for one map. 4.6.8.4 Players may not substitute in another tier on the same match night, but may substitute during the same round in another tier. 4.6.8.4.1 Example: a player may play in the Championship in their own tier on a Wednesday, and a Championship in a higher tier on Friday. 4.6.8.5 A player may not switch teams during concurrently-running matches. 4.7 Cuts 4.7.1 Players may be cut from their team at any time for any reason. 4.7.2 Cut players who are not picked up on waivers will become uncontracted Free Agents. 4.7.2.1 Refer to the Waivers section for more information on the waiver system. 4.7.3 A cut player cannot be picked up by the same team until after the match day following their waiver period ending. 4.7.4 All players must play in 2 maps after being signed or drafted before they may be cut or traded, including pre-season. 4.7.4.1 The maps played must be in regular matches and not scrims, whether they are on a match night or not. 4.7.4.2 Refusing to roster a player under this rule despite their willingness and ability to play will incur punishment. 4.7.4.3 If a player is unable to play in a match before pre-season cuts are due, they may be cut if proof of unresponsiveness or unavailability is provided by a franchise. 4.8 Promotion/Demotion 4.8.1 Players may be promoted at any time, before the draft or during a season, as long as they agree. 4.8.2 If a player is promoted before the draft, they can not be demoted unless they are cut. 4.8.2.1 If they are cut, they will begin their waiver period in the tier they were in prior to being promoted. 4.8.2.2 After being demoted, players must wait 2 match days past their waiver period ending to sign with the franchise they were cut from in their original tier. 4.8.2.3 If a player is promoted before the draft and cut in the preseason, they must sign for a different franchise. They may not return to their original franchise until the next season. This is to prevent franchises dodging early round keeper picks. 4.8.3 If a player is promoted after the draft, they will remain on the team they were promoted to unless they are cut or demoted. 4.8.3.1 Players may be demoted without restriction if they are promoted after the draft. 4.8.4 Players can only be demoted one tier each match day. 4.8.5 Franchises must cut or IR a player in the higher tier in order to promote or demote a player if there is not already a roster slot open. 4.8.6 Promoted or relegated players are available to play in the next match, as long as the transaction is submitted at least 30 minutes prior to the match. 4.8.7 If a promoted player is traded, they retain their contract and must stay in the tier they were promoted to. 4.8.7.1 The new franchise is free to demote the player at any time.","title":"Section 4. Transactions"},{"location":"#section-5-free-agency","text":"5.1 Free Agents 5.1.1 Free Agents have the option to choose which franchise to join if multiple franchises make offers, as long as they are not on waivers. They can choose to decline all offers to remain a Free Agent. 5.1.1.1 If the Free Agent is on waivers, they must follow rule 4.2.8. 5.1.2 Free Agents may agree to a one match temporary contract (a substitution) with a franchise. The MMR of the Free Agent replaces the missing player on the team they are substituting for, and must fit in the MMR cap restrictions. 5.1.2.1 If a Free Agent gets multiple requests to substitute for teams, they are allowed to choose which team they sub for. They may also decline all offers with no consequences. 5.1.2.2 Reminder: Once a player and franchise agree that the player will substitute, they may not back out without consequence and the franchise must roster the player that match day. 5.1.3 RFAs can be moved to Free Agency if the need arises. More info in the next section. 5.1.4 Every 4th match day prior to the playoff roster lock, all Free Agents will be pinged in the Discord. Any who do not respond by the next Tuesday will be marked as inactive and removed from the league. If they return, they can DM an Admin and will return to the FA pool on waivers. 5.2 Restricted Free Agents 5.2.1 Any players that sign up for the league after the draft will enter as a Permanent Free Agent (this has been, and will continue to be, referred to as \"RFA\"). 5.2.2 Generally, RFAs are identical to Free Agents. There are 2 key differences. 5.2.2.1 RFAs can not sub for the same franchise 2 match days in a row. For example, RFAs can substitute for a franchise on match days 4 and 6, but not match days 4 and 5. 5.2.2.2 RFAs can not permanently sign with a franchise. 5.2.3 RFAs have the option to return to the league the next season as a Draft Eligible. If the player wants to remain an RFA due to availability, they should fill out the Intent form as not returning and sign up for RFA when the form goes out. 5.2.4 If at some point during the season the Admins feel that there is a lack of regular free agents for a specific tier, they can promote permanent free agents to regular free agent status to return free agent numbers to an ideal amount. 5.2.4.1 The permanent free agent(s) to be promoted will be determined based on the date and time in which the permanent free agent(s) signed up for the league, with those that signed up earliest being selected first . 5.2.5 RFAs may be moved to regular Free Agency if a tier is in need of Free Agents. 5.2.5.1 During a season, if a tier drops below 0.75 Free Agents per team in the tier, Admins may elect to move RFAs. This is not a set number, and Admins are free to move players to Free Agency if they feel the move is the best option for the health of the tier. 5.2.5.2 RFAs will be asked if they want to move to Free Agent in the order their RFA applications were received. 5.2.5.3 RFAs will be moved until all available RFAs have been moved/requested to remain RFA, or the number of Free Agents per team is greater than 1.5. 5.2.5.4 In order to be moved, RFAs need to have applied for Permanent Free Agency prior to the match day the tier was confirmed to have too few Free Agents per team. 5.2.5.5 RFAs moved to Free Agency will enter there on waivers. 5.2.5.6 Once the season is more than 75% completed, RFAs will no longer be moved to Free Agency, regardless of the number of available Free Agents.","title":"Section 5. Free Agency"},{"location":"#section-6-game-rules-lobbies","text":"6.1 Match Setup Regulations 6.1.1 For each regular season match day,two maps will be played. Each match will be between two teams. In the playoffs, a Best of 3 will be played. 6.1.2 League matches will be played on the most up-to-date patch for all game settings including any and all weapon buffs and nerfs, even if the patch takes place mid-season. This does not include an updated map pool. 6.1.3 League matches will only be played on the 7 maps chosen at the beginning of the season, which is defined by the conclusion of the draft. These maps are currently: 6.1.3.1 Fracture 6.1.3.2 Breeze 6.1.3.3 Icebox 6.1.3.4 Bind 6.1.3.5 Split 6.1.3.6 Ascent 6.1.3.7 Haven 6.1.4 Unless Riot indefinitely removes one of the 7 chosen maps from the game, our pool will remain as is until the following season. 6.1.5 When a new agent is added, they may not be used until the match day 14 days after the patch in which they are introduced. 6.1.5.1 This rule only applies between the draft and the last Championship game of the season. 6.1.6 Spectators are allowed to be in voice comms with teams during a match if a player wants to stream their match to a friend, for example. Spectators are NOT allowed to communicate with the players. If a team is found to have someone who is not playing in the match provide any coaching or other assistance during a match, the match may be retroactively forfeited. 6.2 Game Setup 6.2.1 VDC uses Valorant custom game servers for matches. 6.2.1.1 Matches should be played on Chicago servers by default, unless both teams agree on another server location. 6.2.2 The captain of the home team should create the lobby, friend the opposing captain, and ensure all players on both teams end up in the match. 6.2.3 Game settings should be as follows: 6.2.3.1 Allow Cheats: Off 6.2.3.2 Tournament Mode: On 6.2.3.3 Overtime Win By 2: On 6.2.3.4 Play Out All Rounds: Off 6.2.3.5 Hide Match History: Off 6.2.4 The two maps in a match will be determined by a veto system using mapban.gg. 6.2.4.1 The home team captain will make the mapban.gg lobby and provide the Team 1 link to the away team captain. 6.2.4.2 The order for map vetoes is: Home Ban, Away Ban, Home Ban, Away Ban, Home Pick, Away Pick. 6.2.4.3 Teams choose whether they start Attacking or Defending on their opponents map pick. 6.2.5 If servers go down or are restarted due to an error on Riot's end, the outcomes of any completed halves or pistol rounds should be duplicated as accurately as possible. 6.2.6 If Allow Cheats is left on and a team misuses any part of it, whether intentional or not, the map will be forfeited 0-13. Player stats will not be recorded. 6.2.6.1 If it is clear that a cheat being used was accidental (ex. A player accidentally hitting their Ghost keybind but immediately disabling it with no further incident), no punishment will be incurred and the match can play on as normal. 6.2.7 Teams are allowed up to a 5 minute break between map 1 and map 2 while the lobby is being created and prepared. 6.2.7.1 If all 5 players on a team are not back in the lobby after 5 minutes, a DM should be sent to their captain. After another 5 minutes, the map will be forfeited. 6.2.8 The home team captain is obligated to have the lobby created and set up within 5 minutes of the match start time. The away team captain is obligated to have their team joining the lobby no later than the scheduled match start time. If either obligation is breached, a DM should be sent to the captain not following their duties 5 minutes after the scheduled match start time. 6.2.8.1 10 minutes after the DM is sent, if no valid and verifiable reason is given for the delay, map 1 will be forfeited. 6.2.8.2 15 minutes after the DM is sent, if no valid and verifiable reason is given for the delay, map 2 will be forfeited. 6.3 Playoff Game Setup 6.3.1 Game settings, lobby setup, and delay rules are identical to the regular season. Map vetoes and breaks are handled differently. 6.3.2 During playoffs, the better seeded team will choose whether they veto first or second. The order is as follows: veto-veto, pick-pick, veto-veto, with one map remaining. One team selects their starting side on their opponent's map pick. 6.3.2.1 In map 3, change the \"Allow Cheats\" option to ON. Side selection will be determined by a knife round. 6.3.2.2 After the knife round is completed, teams should use the cheat menu in game to swap teams if necessary and change agents if they wish. After this, the cheat menu should not be used. 6.3.3 If a player misuses any part of the cheat menu, intentionally or not, map 3 will be forfeited by the misusing team and the series is over. Player stats will not be recorded. 6.3.4 For Playoff matches, games beyond the first game have a break period of up to 10 minutes. If one team is not ready at that point, the team that is ready may ping the opposing captain and GM. Once that ping is made, the unready team has 5 minutes to become ready. If they are still not ready, that game is forfeited by the unready team. A substitution or remake of the game will reset all of these timers. 6.4 Bugs and Exploits 6.4.1 Intentional use of any bugs, glitches, exploits, or any other unintended actions is not allowed. Upon receiving a report that a bug was used, Admins will review any available evidence and make a ruling. Admins may award map wins, match wins, and/or levy punishments on the players who break this rule if it is determined that use of the bug impacted the outcome of a map or match. 6.4.2 General examples of things that are not allowed: Moving on, under, or through any areas that are not intended by the map design (any walls, ceilings, floors, etc). The spike can not be placed in an area it can not be defused, or in an area where the Spike does not make any sound. However, it is okay to use Sage walls to block the bomb or secure it in a certain area (such as in the cubby on Icebox B site). Boosting on top of teammates is not allowed when it allows players to see through solid objects or remove textures to give an unfair advantage. Boosting on top of a teammate is otherwise allowed. Pixel walking is forbidden. A player will be considered to be pixel walking if they sit or stand on invisible pixels on the map, where there is no visible edge (such as using Jett updrafts to land on a high up invisible ledge) 6.4.3 It is recommended to check with Admins to find out whether or not a certain bug or glitch is considered legal. Admins reserve the right to make changes, even retroactively, to this list, and rule use of bugs on a case by case basis. 6.5 Pauses and Disconnects 6.5.1 If a player disconnects mid-game, they are allowed to join back as soon as possible. 6.5.2 Teams are allowed to pause when one of their players disconnects or has a technical issue. This should be done using the Pause Match Timer option in the Cheats menu made available by Tournament Mode. 6.5.2.1 When a tech pause is called, the opposing captain should record the time. 6.5.2.2 Teams are allowed to pause for technical issues 2 times per match. Each pause may, but is not required to, last up to 5 minutes. If the first tech pause goes over 5 minutes, the team loses their right to a second tech pause. 6.5.2.3 If the tech issue has not been solved 9 minutes after the pause begins, your captain should warn the opponents in the game chat that they have 1 minute remaining. After this minute passes, the game must be unpaused. Further unreasonable delay may result in a match forfeit. 6.5.3 If a disconnect occurs in a round where the game is won by either team, the match result stands. 6.6 Game Results 6.6.1 The captain of the team that won map 2 should report the score in the proper discord channel. The score report should contain: The series score, the score of each map, the name of each map, and a tracker.gg link to each map. 6.6.2 Scores should be reported in the score reporting channels for the respective tier the match was played in. 6.6.3 For the purpose of tiebreakers, an OT result will be scored 14-12.","title":"Section 6.

In combines, players join lobbies with 9 other VDC players, franchise representatives, and players scouting. 7.1.2 Every VDC player must play in 3 VDC combine matches to qualify for the draft. Outside of that, combines are not required. 7.2 The Draft 7.2.1 The next big event in VDC is the draft. In the draft, every single registered player will be drafted to a team. 7.2.1.1 The draft is a snake draft where, ignoring trades, the franchise that picks first in a round picks last in the next round. 7.2.2 The draft is divided by tier. Players are drafted in the tier they are in at the end of combines. 7.2.3 Franchises who wish to keep a player from a previous season must use a \"Keeper Pick\", the round of which is determined by MMR, to draft them. A keeper pick is a regular draft pick, but instead of drafting a new player the pick is used to keep an already rostered player. 7.2.3.1 If a franchise has more than 1 player requiring a keeper pick in the same round, a better pick must be used unless they trade for another pick in that round. 7.3 Draft Lottery 7.3.1 The draft order is decided by a lottery before offseason transactions open. Each tier has its own lottery. The odds for each team will be determined by two factors as follows: 7.3.1.1 The regular season win rate. 7.3.1.2 Postseason placement score. Elimination in the first round will get a score of 1, second round a score of 2, etc. The runner up will get a score of Semifinal + 1, and the Champion will get a score of Semifinal + 1.5. 7.3.1.3 Lottery Score is calculated with the following formula: (Regular Season Win Rate * 0.70) + (Postseason Placement Score * 0.30). All lottery scores in a tier will be added, and each team will have their odds set to (Team Lottery Score / Tier Total Lottery Score) 7.3.2 When a new tier is added, every team will have the same lottery odds. 7.3.3 If a tier adds new teams equal to, or greater than, the total number of teams in the tier the previous season, draft lottery odds will all be equal regardless of previous season results.","title":"Section 7.

Reschedules must be clearly communicated to Admins in transaction channels. Score reports should specify which match the result is for if the match was rescheduled. 9.1.2.1 If a team is unable to make the rescheduled time, they will forfeit the match. 9.1.2.2 Match reschedules may be submitted at any time and scheduled to be played at any time before the next match day's originally scheduled match time, given both teams agree to play on that date. 9.1.2.3 If the match is rescheduled, the new match time will be treated as equivalent to the original match time for the purposes of all rules contained in this document. 9.1.2.4 Exceptions to these rules may be made in special circumstances, message an Admin if you need to reschedule outside of the allowed period. 9.2 Tiebreakers 9.2.1 If two or more teams have the same regular season record, ties between the teams will be resolved using the following tiebreakers: 9.2.1.1 Head to Head Record 9.2.1.2 Head to Head Round Differential 9.2.1.3 Overall Round Win Percentage 9.2.1.4 (Optional) GM 1v1 on a game of their choice 9.2.1.5 Coin Flip 9.2.2 If there is a tie between 3 or more teams, tiebreakers will be resolved by going down the list and removing teams with a defined advantage or disadvantage in a category. 9.2.2.1 Head to Head is broken by combining all wins and losses, regardless of who they are against. For example, Team A, Team B, Team C, and Team D are in a 4 way tie. Between them, Team A is 5-1, Teams B and C are 3-3, and Team D is 1-5. Team A takes first in the tiebreaker and Team D takes 4th.
